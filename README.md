# AppNossoMascote
The application Nosso Mascote aims to facilitate communication between ngo's that provide pets for adoption and the public interested in adopting an animal partner. Currently, ngo's that take care of abandoned animals (such as dogs and cats) suffers from an overcrowding of animals, as the number of animals rescued is much higher than the number of animals adopted. These ngo's do not have sufficient resources to disseminate the information of all their animals to those interested in adopting a companion. With that in mind, Meu Mascote offers a solution to facilitate accessibility to animal information in ngo's, giving the adopter an easier way to find his animal partner.
